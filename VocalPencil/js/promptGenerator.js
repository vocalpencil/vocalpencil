    let promptTemplate = "According to IELTS speaking scoring criteria for Academic and General Training tests (https://www.ielts.org/for-organisations/ielts-scoring-in-detail): For band 9, the highest level, the criteria are quite stringent. In terms of fluency and coherence, speakers at this level are expected to be fluent with only very occasional repetition or self-correction. Hesitation, if present, serves to prepare the content of the next utterance, not to search for words or grammar. The speaker's speech must be situationally appropriate and cohesive, and topic development should be fully coherent and appropriately extended. In lexical resources, the speaker must demonstrate total flexibility and precision in all contexts, with sustained use of accurate and idiomatic language. In terms of grammatical range and accuracy, structures should be precise and accurate at all times. Pronunciation-wise, the speaker must use a full range of phonological features to convey precise and/or subtle meaning. Band 8 still requires a high degree of proficiency. Speakers should be fluent with only very occasional repetition or self-correction. Hesitation may occasionally occur to find words or grammar. Topic development should be coherent, appropriate and relevant. Lexical resources must be wide, readily and flexibly used to discuss all topics and convey precise meaning. In terms of grammar, a wide range of structures should be flexibly used, and the majority of sentences should be error-free. For pronunciation, speakers should use a wide range of phonological features to convey precise and/or subtle meaning. For band 7, speakers should be able to keep going readily and produce long turns without noticeable effort. Some hesitation, repetition and/or self-correction may occur. Lexical resources should be flexibly used to discuss a variety of topics. In terms of grammar, a range of structures should be flexibly used, and error-free sentences should be frequent. For pronunciation, speakers should display all the positive features of band 6, and some, but not all, of the positive features of band 8. Moving down to band 6, speakers should be able to keep going and demonstrate a willingness to produce long turns. Coherence may be lost at times due to hesitation, repetition, and/or self-correction. In terms of lexical resources, speakers should have enough to discuss topics at length. For grammar, they should produce a mix of short and complex sentence forms and a variety of structures with limited flexibility. In terms of pronunciation, speakers should use a range of phonological features, but control is variable. Band 5 requires speakers to usually keep going, but they might rely on repetition and self-correction to do so. Hesitations are often associated with mid-sentence searches for fairly basic lexis and grammar. Lexical resources should be sufficient to discuss familiar and unfamiliar topics but with limited flexibility. Grammar-wise, basic sentence forms should be fairly well controlled for accuracy. In terms of pronunciation, speakers should display all the positive features of band 4, and some, but not all, of the positive features of band 6. For band 4, speakers should be able to link simple sentences but often with repetitious use of connectives. There might be some breakdowns in coherence. Lexical resources should be sufficient for familiar topics but only basic meaning can be conveyed on unfamiliar topics. In terms of grammar, speakers can produce basic sentence forms and some short utterances are error-free. In terms of pronunciation, speakers should use some acceptable phonological features, but the range is limited. Band 3 requires speakers to have frequent, sometimes long, pauses occur while they search for words. They have a limited ability to link simple sentences and go beyond simple responses to questions. Lexical resources are limited to simple vocabulary used primarily to convey personal information. In terms of grammar, basic sentence forms are attempted but grammatical errors are numerous. In terms of pronunciation, speakers display some features of band 2, and some, but not all, of the positive features of band 4. At band 2, lengthy pauses before nearly every word are common. The speaker's speech may be of virtually no communicative significance. The lexical resources are very limited, and utterances consist of isolated words or memorised utterances. Little communication is possible without the support of mime or gesture. In terms of grammar, there's no evidence of basic sentence forms. For pronunciation, individual words and phonemes are mainly mispronounced, causing a lack of clarity. Band 1 speakers demonstrate virtually no coherent speech. The lexical resources are restricted to a few isolated words. No communication is possible, and there's no rateable language unless memorised. In terms of pronunciation, the speaker can produce occasional individual words and phonemes that are recognisable, but no overall meaning is conveyed. Lastly, band 0 is given to candidates who do not attend the test. The band descriptors serve to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the speaker's abilities, but it's important to remember that candidates will be rated on their average performance across all parts of the test. You are tasked to evaluate the following speaking transcription according to the IELTS Speaking Levels. Act as a IELTS examiner, your tasks include: ## Your speaking transcript: Add capitalization and punctuation but don't make any change to the text. ## Summary: present a table of Strengths, Weaknesses of using English, and Solutions for improvement. ## Error Identification: The script is generated from a speech  to text transcribing tool, guess what error is possiblely due to inaccurate pronunciation, and identify any grammatical errors in the script and list them as a table with errors and corrections, for possible pronunciation error, give the correct word with both UK and US phonetic transcription, avoid comment on capitalization and punctuation. If no error is found, say God job, no error is identified. ## Content and coherence: the flow of narrative, logic of arguments coherence of content, how well the information and ideas are developed. ## Vocabulary Enhancement: Suggest better word choices if applicable, do not repeat the words identified in Error Identification, and focus on other word choices that could improve the score. List them as a table with original word, suggested word, and reason why suggested word can potentially get a higher score. ## Improvement to Band 9: Propose an improved version of the script that would meet the criteria for Band 9.

It is highly intelligible and exhibits sustained, coherent discourse. A response at this level is characterized by all of the following: Generally well-paced flow (fluid expression). Speech is clear. It may include minor lapses, or minor difficulties with pronunciation or intonation patterns, which do not affect overall intelligibility. The response demonstrates effective use of grammar and vocabulary. It exhibits a fairly high degree of automaticity with good control of basic and complex structures (as appropriate). Some minor (or systematic) errors are noticeable but do not obscure meaning. Response is sustained and sufficient to the task. It is generally well developed and coherent; relationships between ideas are clear (or there is a clear progression of ideas). Leve 3: The response addresses the task appropriately but may fall short of being fully developed. It is generally intelligible and coherent, with some fluidity of expression, though it exhibits some noticeable lapses in the expression of ideas. A response at this level is characterized by at least two of the following: Speech is generally clear, with some fluidity of expression, though minor difficulties with pronunciation, intonation, or pacing are noticeable and may require listener effort at times (though overall intelligibility is not significantly affected). The response demonstrates fairly automatic and effective use of grammar and vocabulary, and fairly coherent expression of relevant ideas. Response may exhibit some imprecise or inaccurate use of vocabulary or grammatical structures or be somewhat limited in the range of structures used. This may affect overall fluency, but it does not seriously interfere with the communication of the message. Response is mostly coherent and sustained and conveys relevant ideas/information. Overall development is somewhat limited, usually lacks elaboration or specificity. Relationships between ideas may at times not be immediately clear. Level 2: The response addresses the task, but development of the topic is limited. It contains intelligible speech, although problems with delivery and/or overall coherence occur; meaning may be obscured in places. A response at this level is characterized by at least two of the following: Speech is basically intelligible, though listener effort is needed because of unclear articulation, awkward intonation, or choppy rhythm/pace; meaning may be obscured in places.The response demonstrates limited range and control of grammar and vocabulary. These limitations often prevent full expression of ideas. For the most part, only basic sentence structures are used successfully and spoken with fluidity. Structures and vocabulary may express mainly simple (short) and/or general propositions, with simple or unclear connections made among them (serial listing, conjunction, juxtaposition). The response is connected to the task, though the number of ideas presented or the development of ideas is limited. Mostly basic ideas are expressed with limited elaboration (details and support). At times relevant substance may be vaguely expressed or repetitious. Connections of ideas may be unclear. Level 1: The response is very limited in content and/or coherence or is only minimally connected to the task, or speech is largely unintelligible. A response at this level is characterized by at least two of the following: Consistent pronunciation, stress and intonation difficulties cause considerable listener effort; delivery is choppy, fragmented, or telegraphic; frequent pauses and hesitations. Range and control of grammar and vocabulary severely limit or prevent expression of ideas and connections among ideas. Some low-level responses may rely heavily on practiced or formulaic expressions. Limited relevant content is expressed. The response generally lacks substance beyond the expression of very basic ideas. The speaker may be unable to sustain speech to complete the task and may rely heavily on repetition of the prompt. You are tasked to evaluate the following speaking transcription according to the TOEFL Speaking Levels. Act as a TOEFL examiner, your tasks include: ## Your speaking transcript: Add capitalization and punctuation but don't make any change to the text. ## Summary: present a table of Strengths, Weaknesses of using English, and Solutions for improvement. ## Error Identification: The script is generated from a speech  to text transcribing tool, guess what error is possiblely due to inaccurate pronunciation, and identify any grammatical errors in the script and list them as a table with errors and corrections, for possible pronunciation error, give the correct word with both UK and US phonetic transcription, avoid comment on capitalization and punctuation.

The prompt is thoroughly addressed and explored, with all questions being directly answered. Ideas are relevant, completely extended, and strongly supported. Any lapses in content or support are extremely rare. Cohesion is so smoothly executed that it rarely attracts attention, and any lapses are minimal. The communication flows effortlessly, and the paragraphing is skillfully managed. The vocabulary used is diverse, accurate, and apt, with a very sophisticated control of lexical features. Spelling errors and word formation mistakes are extremely rare and have a minimal impact on communication. Structures exhibit wide range, full flexibility, and control. The correct use of grammar and punctuation is consistently maintained, with minor errors being extremely rare. In Band 8, the prompt is adequately addressed. A clear and well-developed position is presented as a response to the questions. The ideas provided are relevant, well extended, and supported, though there might be occasional lapses in content. The message is easily followable, and the information and ideas are logically sequenced. Cohesion is generally well managed, with only occasional lapses. Paragraphing is used sufficiently and appropriately. The vocabulary is wide and used fluently and flexibly to convey precise meanings. Despite occasional inaccuracies in word choice and collocation, there is skilful use of uncommon and/or idiomatic items. Errors in spelling and/or word formation may occur but they have minimal impact on communication. A wide range of structures is flexibly and accurately used, and most sentences are error-free. Band 7 presents a clear and developed position, although there might be a tendency to over-generalize or a lack of focus in supporting ideas. Main ideas are extended and supported, and the response generally exhibits a logical progression. Cohesive devices are used flexibly but with occasional inaccuracies or overuse. Paragraphing effectively supports the overall coherence, and within-paragraph sequencing is mostly logical. The vocabulary is sufficient for some flexibility and precision, and a certain degree of control over less common items is evident. In spite of a few errors in spelling and/or word formation, the meaning remains clear. A variety of complex structures is used, with reasonable control over grammar and punctuation. For Band 6, the main parts of the prompt are addressed, albeit some more than others. The position presented is directly relevant to the prompt, though the conclusions drawn may be unclear or repetitive. Some main ideas may lack clarity or be insufficiently developed, and some supporting arguments may be less relevant or inadequate. The response displays a clear overall progression, and cohesive devices are generally used well, despite occasional misuse or overuse. The vocabulary is adequate for the task, though the range may be limited, and some errors in spelling and/or word formation do not impede communication. Structures are a mix of simple and complex forms, with more complex forms showing less accuracy. In Band 5, the main parts of the prompt are incompletely addressed, and the position expressed may not be clearly developed. Main ideas are limited and not sufficiently developed, with some irrelevant details and potential repetition. Organization and progression may be lacking, and sentence fluency is limited. There may be overuse or limited use of cohesive devices with some inaccuracies. Vocabulary is simple and accurately used, but lacks variation in expression. Notable errors in spelling and/or word formation may cause some difficulty for the reader. The range of structures is limited and repetitive, with complex sentences often being faulty. For Band 4, the response to the prompt is minimal, or tangential. Main ideas lack relevance, clarity, and/or support and may be hard to identify. The response is not logically organized and has no clear progression. Basic cohesive devices may be used inaccurately or repetitively, and there may be no paragraphing. The vocabulary is basic and repetitively used. Errors in word formation and/or spelling may impede meaning. Structures are very limited, with grammatical errors being frequent and potentially impeding meaning. Band 3 indicates that no part of the prompt is adequately addressed or that the prompt has been misunderstood. No relevant position can be identified, and there are few ideas presented, which may be irrelevant or insufficiently developed. The response lacks logical organization, and any paragraphing attempts are unhelpful. Vocabulary is inadequate, with a potential over-dependence on input material or memorized language. There are many errors in word formation and spelling, which may severely impede meaning. The response may be too short to provide evidence of control of sentence forms. In Band 2, the content is barely related to the prompt, and no position can be identified. There may be glimpses of one or two ideas without development, and the entire response may be off-topic. Vocabulary is extremely limited, with few recognizable strings, apart from memorised phrases. There is no control of word formation and/or spelling. The use of sentence forms is limited, except in memorised phrases. For Band 1, responses of 20 words or fewer are rated. The content is wholly unrelated to the prompt, and any copied rubric must be discounted. The writing fails to communicate any message and appears to be by a virtual non-writer. No resource is apparent, except for a few isolated words, and no rateable language is evident. Band 0 should only be used when the requirements for Band 1 are not met. Act as a IELTS examiner, your tasks include: ## Summary: present a table of Strengths, Weaknesses of using English, and Solutions for improvement. ## Error Identification: Identify any grammatical and spelling errors in the writing and list them as a table with errors and corrections If no error is found, say God job, no error is identified. ## Content and coherence: the flow of narrative, logic of arguments coherence of content, how well the information and ideas are developed. ## Vocabulary Enhancement: Suggest better word choices if applicable, do not repeat the words identified in Error Identification, and focus on other word choices that could improve the score.

An essay falling within this band largely accomplishes all of the following: it effectively addresses the topic and task, is well organized and well developed, employing appropriate explanations, exemplifications, and/or details. It demonstrates unity, progression, and coherence. Additionally, the essay displays consistent facility in the use of language, manifesting syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and idiomaticity. However, it may contain minor lexical or grammatical errors. The Score 4 also exhibits considerable proficiency, though with a few potential weaknesses. An essay in this band addresses the topic and task well, though some points may not be fully elaborated. It is generally well organized and well developed, utilizing appropriate and sufficient explanations, exemplifications, and/or details. The essay displays unity, progression, and coherence, though it may contain occasional redundancy, digression, or unclear connections. The essay also demonstrates facility in the use of language, presenting syntactic variety and a range of vocabulary. However, it is likely to have occasional noticeable minor errors in structure, word form, or use of idiomatic language that do not interfere with meaning. Essays in the Score 3 demonstrate a slightly lower level of proficiency and may exhibit one or more weaknesses. An essay at this level addresses the topic and task using somewhat developed explanations, exemplifications, and/or details. It displays unity, progression, and coherence, though the connection of ideas may be occasionally obscured. The essay may demonstrate inconsistent facility in sentence formation and word choice that may result in a lack of clarity and occasionally obscure meaning. Furthermore, it may display accurate but limited range of syntactic structures and vocabulary. The Score 2 exhibits more significant weaknesses. An essay at this level may reveal limited development in response to the topic and task, inadequate organization or connection of ideas, inappropriate or insufficient exemplifications, explanations or details to support or illustrate generalizations in response to the task. It may also present a noticeably inappropriate choice of words or word forms, and an accumulation of errors in sentence structure and/or usage. The Score 1, marking a low level of proficiency, encompasses essays that largely demonstrate serious disorganization or underdevelopment, little or no detail, irrelevant specifics, or questionable responsiveness to the task. Furthermore, these essays exhibit serious and frequent errors in sentence structure or usage. The Score 0, at the lowest level of proficiency, characterizes essays that merely copy words from the topic, reject the topic, or are otherwise not connected to the topic. Additionally, these essays may be written in a foreign language, consist of keystroke characters, or be blank.
