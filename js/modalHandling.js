      <h7>How do I use VocalPencil for improving my English skills?</h7>
      <p class="font-weight-light text-secondary">On both the Speaking and Writing pages, record your speech or type your text, Click 'Copy Prompt for Feedback' and select the type of English proficiency test (CELPIP, IELTS, or TOEFL), then paste it to your chatbot such as ChatGPT to receive your personalized feedback.</p>
  
      <h7>Can I use the prompts for grading my speaking or writing?</h7>
  <p class="font-weight-light text-secondary">VocalPencil uses established English proficiency test rubrics to provide feedback on your spoken or written responses. However, the accuracy of the results may vary and may not always be consistent, even for the same content. Therefore, we recommend using the feedback provided as a tool for practice and improvement rather than as a precise grading system. We strive to guide users towards improvement, not mislead with potentially inaccurate scores.</p>
  
  
      <h7>How accurate is the feedback I receive from the chatbot?</h7>
  <p class="font-weight-light text-secondary">
  The feedback provided by the chatbot are based on the rubrics from the official English proficiency test websites. Please note that the accuracy and quality of the feedback also greatly depends on the chatbot you are using for evaluation. VocalPencil merely provides a platform for you to generate and format your inputs but does not participate in the analysis or evaluation of your content. These results should be used for learning purposes and as a tool for improvement rather than as a definitive prediction of actual exam scores.
